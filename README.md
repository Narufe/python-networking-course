# Python Fundamentals for Automation – Learning Notes

This repository contains my solutions and notes from the **Kirk Byers – PyNet Free Python Course**, which I followed as part of building a strong foundation in Python before moving into network automation.

The course is delivered in an **email-based weekly format**. Each week includes:
- Curated links to videos and reading materials covering specific Python concepts  
- Additional reference articles for deeper understanding  
- A set of practical exercises to implement and solve

## Learning Approach

For each week of the course, I followed a structured learning process:

1. Watched the provided videos and followed along by coding the examples  
2. Read the recommended articles to reinforce the concepts  
3. Solved the assigned exercises independently  
4. Uploaded working solutions to GitHub, with comments or explanations where helpful  

I completed **approximately 5 weeks out of the 10-week course**, focusing on building strong Python fundamentals before progressing to network automation tools.

## Topics Covered

The completed sections focus on core Python concepts, including:

- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Data types and data structures (lists, dictionaries, strings)
- Writing clear, readable scripts to solve practical problems
- Problem solving using Python logic

## Purpose

This repository represents **foundational preparation for network automation**, and complements my hands-on networking labs.

The goal of this work was to:
- Build confidence reading and writing Python code  
- Develop logical problem-solving skills  
- Establish a solid base before moving into network-focused libraries and tools  

Future learning will extend these fundamentals into networking automation use cases.
